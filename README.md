# Event Fan Follow [![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)](#isc-license)

## Overview
---- 
**Event Fan Follow** is a web-based application designed to provide a user-friendly and intuitive method to simulatenously retrieving event ticket information combined with geolocation services on the client side. Overall, this application utilizes dynamic ```JavaScript``` to execute ```API``` related data processing in combination with packages such as ```JQuery```, ```Bootstrap```, ```Google Maps API```, and ```Ticketmaster API``` all conveniently tied together via ```HTML``` on the client side.
Upon opening the application, the user is presented with a form. They can fill out the city that they’re visiting, the date, what type of event they are looking for, and they can sort by a variety of options. Once the form is complete and the events render, the user is also presented with a google map to make getting to the event a breeze.

## Motivation for Development
--- 
As a team comprised of avid travelers, we wanted a one-stop shop to see all events happening and how to get there. 

## User story
---
```
- As a traveler and fan of live events
- I want access to certain events in the area that I am visiting
- So that I can experience all that the city has to offer.
```
## Acceptance Criteria
---
```
- Given I am planning a trip to a new city
- When I select my destination city, date, and event type
- Then I am presented with a list of events that I can check out.
```

## Contributions
---
* Arely and Aram tackled the API connections: 
* Arely worked on the TicketMaster API and making it functional
* Aram worked on the Google Maps API, and having the map render! 

* Mallory and Todd handled the site layout and design: 
* The navigation bar, building of the form, and local storage. 

## Challenges
--- 
Working on branches and merging into main has proven to be a challenge for API squad. Google Maps API turned out to be very finicky. 

## Successes
---
The four of us worked REALLY well together! Brainstorming was fun and we came up with a few ideas, but ultimately decided on Event Fan Follow. Once we started work on the app, we delegated tasks but helped each other with road-blocks as they came up. It was exciting to see the APIs start to bring in information and see our hard work in action.

## Future Development
---
```
- create a 'Load More' feature and a scroll to view all events. 
- Create additional HTML pages for nav bar links - ex: contact us.  
- Options to print directions.
- Options to link and open the Google Maps app.
- Connect to Spotify to allow users to check out the artists prior to committing to event.
- Connect additional ticket APIs - ex: LiveNation or EventBrite.
- Add ability to bookmark events that you’re interested in.
- Connect to users personal calendar to save events.  
- Build in sections for advertising/sponsorship partners.
```
